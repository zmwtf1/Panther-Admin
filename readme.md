# Information about Panther Admin, and Prison Life.

Prison Life is releasing new updates, I am terribly sorry if stuff gets patched. I have a life so I don't update everything all the time.

It is not my fault if you get banned in Prison Life, by executing any Panther Admin version, you are agreeing that I am not responsible for any in game punishments taken.
